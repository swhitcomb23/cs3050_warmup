Keywords: make, model, year, BHP/bhp, transmission, convertible, and, help

logical operators: ==, <=, >=, <, >, !=

example queries:
    make == Porsche and BHP > 1000
    model == "911 Porsche"
    year >= 2001 and convertible == True
These queries would return that entire cars given information

functional interface:
we are going to supply this function with keywords stripped from input by the parsing function, specifically
a keyword parameter, a optional logical parameter, and a object parameter. The function will return the full data
of the car(s) it is being asked to find and supply this data to a printing function to make it readable. The interface
will use pythons API to interact with the firestore database and make get calls to retrieve said data.
